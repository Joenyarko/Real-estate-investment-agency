        <h2>WHY IS REAL ESATATE INVETSMENT A SAFE HAVEN AGAINST INFLATION IN GHANA
        </h2>
        <p>In 2020, Ghana’s economy experience positive growth despite the global challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Today Ghana is facing economic challenges like many countries due to macroeconomic instability, global financing tightening, and spillover effect of the Russian Ukraine war as a result forcing the state’s government to over borrow.  Ghana’s inflation rise from 10% in 2021 to 31.5% in 2022 driven by food and energy prices and depreciating local currency.</p>
   <br>
   <h2>How does real estate property act as a good buffer against inflation and currency depreciation?
</h2>
<p>As an investor you might love to focus on investing in asset classes that prosper during currency depreciation in order to be prepared for future financial downturn. Real estate is one financial asset that keeps up with inflationary pressures and can be used as a strong hedge that ensures investors to continue to receive an appreciative income. Because Real Estate is limited in supply, it has intrinsic value and may appreciate over time as inflation rises.</p>
